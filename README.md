# dioxus-actix-mlops
NLP inferencing SPA written in Rust, with pretrained transformers implemented in actix-web server. Frontend based on Dioxus framework with TailwindCSS styling. Made for educational purposes with the aim to produce a web app leveraging pretrained BERT models for a range of NLP tasks (e.g. summarization, sentiment analysis etc.). The app is intended to yield high throughput in inferencing through concurrency. Current implementation relies on calls to REST API backend, introducing latency. Future implementation aims to optimize inferencing in browser via WebAssembly.

Current functionality is limited to translation, with support for 4 languages: English, French, Spanish and German. However, the M2M100 transformer powering translation supports up to 100 languages. The rust_bert framework powering the inferencing also provides a variety of transformers of different sizes.
